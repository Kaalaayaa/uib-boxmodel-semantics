    <h1>Pottery: How to get started</h1>
<hr>
    <h2>Main Techniques of Making Pottery</h2>

<p>There are two main methods of making pottery: <strong>hand built</strong> and <strong>wheel thrown</strong>. The easiest to start with with is the hand building method, since you just need your hands and a piece of clay. There are three main techniques involved in making hand building pottery:</p>

<p>Pinch pot – a simple form of hand-made pottery that’s been around since ancient times. The potter kneads the clay and presses it into the shape of a pot, dish, bowl or cup.
<br>
<br>
Coiling – using clay, the potter rolls it until it forms a long roll. Then, by placing one coil on top of another, different shapes are formed.
<br>
<br>
Slab – a thick, flat plate, or slice of clay is cut into shapes which are then joined to form an object. The joined edges are scored and slip is used (slip is clay diluted with water to the consistency of cream, used for joining individual pieces of clay).
<br>
<br>
Wheel-thrown pottery, however, requires special knowledge about how to work the wheel and handle the clay while it’s spinning, among other things. Pottery wheels are used to mold clay into many different shapes. It takes time to become skilled with wheel-throwing, but it’s a much more efficient method once mastered. Pottery wheels can be powered by electricity or manually by the potter kicking their leg.</p>

<h3>Types of Clay Pottery</h3>
<p>Now that you know the two main techniques to creating pottery, let’s take a look at the materials you’ll need. First, and most importantly, is the type of clay used. Broadly speaking clay can be classified as earthenware, stoneware or porcelain.
<br>
<br>
Earthenware is made of baked clay, and often finished in a glaze. Because it’s a porous material, earthenware pottery can crack when exposed to water or heated, such as in the dishwasher.
<br>
<br>
Stoneware (which is what we use) is one of the most popular clay materials to make tableware with because of its imperviousness to liquid and heat. While it’s hard like porcelain, it’s opaque like earthenware and available in colors from white to tan, red and speckled. The exact composition of stoneware clay can also vary greatly and depending on the region or recipe you’re following the consistency can range from smooth (few impurities) to rough (many additives). Feel the bottom of any pot and you’ll see what we’re talking about. Each mug we make is silky smooth which means we’re using the purest select clay that we can find.
<br>
<br>
Porcelain pottery closely resembles glass and does best with a dialed in firing process that makes sure that the required firing temperatures were reached. We would not advise starting with  this material. It would be better to hone your skills on either earthenware or stoneware before moving up to porcelain.</p>

    <h3>Main Equipment Needed</h3>

    <p>Beginning potters should know the different techniques and materials used for creating pottery, as well as the relevant, required pottery equipment to achieve various forms.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>KILN: The main piece of equipment you’ll need to get your pottery hobby off the ground is a kiln – a simple device for firing and baking glazes onto the pottery. The primary reason that you will want a kiln is to chemically transform the clay into a permanent lasting relic. While not necessary for smaller pieces that won’t come into contact with water, a kiln is necessary for creating pieces that you will want to use, like tableware, cups or vases.</li>
        <li>POTTERY WHEEL: If you’re interested in making more advanced ceramic pieces, you’ll need to invest in a potter’s wheel. These wheels come in both electrical-powered and manual-powered styles, both offering different advantages and disadvantages.</li>
        <li>POTTERY MODELING STAND: If you’re sticking with the hand building method of making pottery, a pottery molding stand will come in handy. While not a required piece of equipment, it does make the creation process easier. The potter simply places their slab of clay on this raised, fully rotational surface area, making it simple to form.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Main Tools Used</h3>
    <p>While the above equipment is crucial, you’ll also need a variety of special tools to craft the piece of pottery you’re envisioning. There aren’t too many needed right away – in fact, your hands are the main tools you’ll use throughout the entire process. However, there are a few items that can make the process easier, more efficient while helping you expand your abilities</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Apron and towels – pottery is a very messy form of art. Don’t wreck your clothes and keep your hands clean with an apron and towels.</li>
        <li>Sponges – these versatile tools are incredibly useful when working at the potter’s wheel. Sponges help absorb or distribute water during throwing, making it easier to mold and shape the clay. A sponge attached to an extender can help remove or distribute water to and from hard to reach areas.</li>
        <li>Wire – you’ll need a thin piece of wire in order to remove the piece of pottery from the wheel once it’s complete. The wire is usually nylon or metal with wooden notches at each end which the user holds.</li>
        <li>Ribs and scrapers – these handy tools help shape and smooth pottery as it’s being formed on the wheel. They can also be used during the rib-and-hand technique used on coiled pottery.</li>
        <li>Potter’s needles – these specialized pottery tools resemble long needles and are perfect for a variety of different uses, such as trimming edges on a wheel or scoring slabs of clay for hand throwing applications.</li>
        <li>Fettling knives – available in soft or hard temper, these knives can be used to achieve desired angled and curved cuts. Soft fettling knives are flexible and can be bent into a variety of shapes, while hard fettling knives are more inflexible and are better for making clean, straight cuts.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Understanding Glazes</h2>

<p>Pottery glaze doesn’t just give the piece a better-looking aesthetic, it also seals the pottery, protecting it from
damaging water and heat. After the pottery goes through its initial firing stage to dry the piece, glaze is applied and
placed into the kiln again for a second firing. The glaze material melts and sticks to the pottery, providing
protection, waterproofing and enhanced aesthetic to the piece.
<br>
<br>
Glazes normally come in three types of finish, matte, opaque and gloss. In general, gloss finish is used for pottery
like tableware, as it’s shiny, easy to clean and non-porous. Matte, offering no shine, is generally used to create a
more subdued, sophisticated look. Opaque simply describes a glaze that can’t be seen through, thus covering the surface
and color of the clay. Of course, not all pottery requires a glaze flowerpots, for instance, may be crafted without
being glazed.
<br>
<br>
There are also sub-categories of these different glazes, such as semi-transparent, semi-gloss and semi-opaque, among
others. You’ll have to test a few to find out which style you prefer.
<br>
<br>
Glazes come in literally thousands of combinations of colors, textures, styles and types that can be applied in many
different ways and fired at a range of temperatures. Some glazes may be vividly colored but still have aspects of the
clay showing beneath. For example, you can use a speckled clay and a transparent glaze which can create an interesting
and unique look.</p>
